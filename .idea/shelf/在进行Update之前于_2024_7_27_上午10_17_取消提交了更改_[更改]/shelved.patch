-   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

-   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-   meet the following conditions:
-
-   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

-   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-       the Derivative Works; and
-
-   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-       as modifying the License.
-
-   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

-
-5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

-   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-
-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

-	actual parameter, it may be important to preserve any sharing
-	of the string or sequence within the object graph being

-	referential integrity in this way, this requirement is
-	conveniently handled by using a value type. Value types also
-	support the transmission of nulls (as a distinguished value),
-	whereas IDL data types such as string and sequence (which are
-	mapped to empty strings and sequences) do not. The Java to IDL
-	mapping requires both preservation of referential integrity
-	and transmission of nulls. Because it would be cumbersome to
-	require the full IDL syntax for a value type for this specific
-	usage, this shorthand notation is introduced to cover this use
-	of value types for simple containment of a single data member.

-
-Must reproduce following license in documentation and/or other materials
-provided with distribution:
-
-The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
-with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
-fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS",
-and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
-
-This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
-All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
-
-Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute
-this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee,
-subject to these conditions:
-
-(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,
-then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty
-notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original
-files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
-
-(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation
-must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the
-Independent JPEG Group".
-
-(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
-full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
-NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
-
-These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
-not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
-acknowledge us.
-
-Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
-in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived
-from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG
-Group's software".
-
-We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis
-of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
-assumed by the product vendor.
-
-
-ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
-sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
-ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
-by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
-that you must include source code if you redistribute it.
-(See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is
-not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not
-limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
-
-The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
-It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
-The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
-ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
-by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
-
-It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
-by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding
-cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this
-reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
-JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
-over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
-implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are
-no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
-
-The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
-To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
-has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
-produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;
-the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all
-standard GIF decoders.
-
-We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is
-the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a
-Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

-
-6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-
-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-

-#####################################################################
-#	Default Configuration File for Java Platform Management
-#####################################################################
-#
-# The Management Configuration file (in java.util.Properties format)
-# will be read if one of the following system properties is set:
-#    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=<port-number>
-# or -Dcom.sun.management.snmp.port=<port-number>
-# or -Dcom.sun.management.config.file=<this-file>
-#
-# The default Management Configuration file is:
-#
-#       $JRE/lib/management/management.properties
-#
-# Another location for the Management Configuration File can be specified
-# by the following property on the Java command line:
-#
-#    -Dcom.sun.management.config.file=<this-file>
-#
-# If -Dcom.sun.management.config.file=<this-file> is set, the port
-# number for the management agent can be specified in the config file
-# using the following lines:
-#
-# ################ Management Agent Port #########################
-#
-# For setting the JMX RMI agent port use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=<port-number>
-#
-# For setting the SNMP agent port use the following line
-# com.sun.management.snmp.port=<port-number>
-
-#####################################################################
-#                   Optional Instrumentation
-#####################################################################
-#
-# By default only the basic instrumentation with low overhead is on.
-# The following properties allow to selectively turn on optional
-# instrumentation which are off by default and may have some
-# additional overhead.
-#
-# com.sun.management.enableThreadContentionMonitoring
-#
-#      This option enables thread contention monitoring if the
-#      Java virtual machine supports such instrumentation.
-#      Refer to the specification for the java.lang.management.ThreadMBean
-#      interface - see isThreadContentionMonitoringSupported() method.
-#
-
-# To enable thread contention monitoring, uncomment the following line
-# com.sun.management.enableThreadContentionMonitoring
-
-#####################################################################
-#			SNMP Management Properties
-#####################################################################
-#
-# If the system property -Dcom.sun.management.snmp.port=<port-number>
-# is set then
-#	- The SNMP agent (with the Java virtual machine MIB) is started
-#	  that listens on the specified port for incoming SNMP requests.
-#	- the following properties for read for SNMP management.
-#
-# The configuration can be specified only at startup time.
-# Later changes to the above system property (e.g. via setProperty method), this
-# config file, or the ACL file has no effect to the running SNMP agent.
-#
-
-#
-# ##################### SNMP Trap Port #########################
-#
-# com.sun.management.snmp.trap=<trap-destination-port-number>
-#      Specifies the remote port number at which managers are expected
-#      to listen for trap. For each host defined in the ACL file,
-#      the SNMP agent will send traps at <host>:<trap-destination-port-number>
-#      Default for this property is 162.
-#
-
-# To set port for sending traps to a different port use the following line
-# com.sun.management.snmp.trap=<trap-destination-port-number>
-
-#
-# ################ SNMP listen interface #########################
-#
-# com.sun.management.snmp.interface=<InetAddress>
-#      Specifies the local interface on which the SNMP agent will bind.
-#      This is useful when running on machines which have several
-#      interfaces defined. It makes it possible to listen to a specific
-#      subnet accessible through that interface.
-#      Default for this property is "localhost".
-#
-#      The format of the value for that property is any string accepted
-#      by java.net.InetAddress.getByName(String).
-#
-
-# For restricting the port on which SNMP agent listens use the following line
-# com.sun.management.snmp.interface=<InetAddress>
-
-#
-# #################### SNMP ACL file #########################
-#
-# com.sun.management.snmp.acl=true|false
-#      Default for this property is true. (Case for true/false ignored)
-#      If this property is specified as false then the ACL file
-#      is not checked:  all manager hosts are allowed all access.
-#
-
-# For SNMP without checking ACL file uncomment the following line
-# com.sun.management.snmp.acl=false
-
-#
-# com.sun.management.snmp.acl.file=filepath
-#      Specifies location for ACL file
-#      This is optional - default location is
-#      $JRE/lib/management/snmp.acl
-#
-#      If the property "com.sun.management.snmp.acl" is set to false,
-#      then this property and the ACL file are ignored.
-#      Otherwise the ACL file must exist and be in the valid format.
-#      If the ACL file is empty or non existent then no access is allowed.
-#
-#      The SNMP agent will read the ACL file at startup time.
-#      Modification to the ACL file has no effect to any running SNMP
-#      agents which read that ACL file at startup.
-#
-
-# For a non-default acl file location use the following line
-# com.sun.management.snmp.acl.file=filepath
-
-#####################################################################
-#			RMI Management Properties
-#####################################################################
-#
-# If system property -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=<port-number>
-# is set then
-#     - A MBean server is started
-#     - JRE Platform MBeans are registered in the MBean server
-#     - RMI connector is published  in a private readonly registry at
-#       specified port using a well known name, "jmxrmi"
-#     - the following properties are read for JMX remote management.
-#
-# The configuration can be specified only at startup time.
-# Later changes to above system property (e.g. via setProperty method),
-# this config file, the password file, or the access file have no effect to the
-# running MBean server, the connector, or the registry.
-#
-
-#
-# ########## RMI connector settings for local management ##########
-#
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=true|false
-#      Default for this property is true. (Case for true/false ignored)
-#      If this property is specified as true then the local JMX RMI connector
-#      server will only accept connection requests from clients running on
-#      the host where the out-of-the-box JMX management agent is running.
-#      In order to ensure backwards compatibility this property could be
-#      set to false. However, deploying the local management agent in this
-#      way is discouraged because the local JMX RMI connector server will
-#      accept connection requests from any client either local or remote.
-#      For remote management the remote JMX RMI connector server should
-#      be used instead with authentication and SSL/TLS encryption enabled.
-#
-
-# For allowing the local management agent accept local
-# and remote connection requests use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false
-
-#
-# ###################### RMI SSL #############################
-#
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=true|false
-#      Default for this property is true. (Case for true/false ignored)
-#      If this property is specified as false then SSL is not used.
-#
-
-# For RMI monitoring without SSL use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
-
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.config.file=filepath
-#      Specifies the location of the SSL configuration file. A properties
-#      file can be used to supply the keystore and truststore location and
-#      password settings thus avoiding to pass them as cleartext in the
-#      command-line.
-#
-#      The current implementation of the out-of-the-box management agent will
-#      look up and use the properties specified below to configure the SSL
-#      keystore and truststore, if present:
-#          javax.net.ssl.keyStore=<keystore-location>
-#          javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<keystore-password>
-#          javax.net.ssl.trustStore=<truststore-location>
-#          javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<truststore-password>
-#      Any other properties in the file will be ignored. This will allow us
-#      to extend the property set in the future if required by the default
-#      SSL implementation.
-#
-#      If the property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl" is set to false,
-#      then this property is ignored.
-#
-
-# For supplying the keystore settings in a file use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.config.file=filepath
-
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.enabled.cipher.suites=<cipher-suites>
-#      The value of this property is a string that is a comma-separated list
-#      of SSL/TLS cipher suites to enable. This property can be specified in
-#      conjunction with the previous property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl"
-#      in order to control which particular SSL/TLS cipher suites are enabled
-#      for use by accepted connections. If this property is not specified then
-#      the SSL/TLS RMI Server Socket Factory uses the SSL/TLS cipher suites that
-#      are enabled by default.
-#
-
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.enabled.protocols=<protocol-versions>
-#      The value of this property is a string that is a comma-separated list
-#      of SSL/TLS protocol versions to enable. This property can be specified in
-#      conjunction with the previous property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl"
-#      in order to control which particular SSL/TLS protocol versions are
-#      enabled for use by accepted connections. If this property is not
-#      specified then the SSL/TLS RMI Server Socket Factory uses the SSL/TLS
-#      protocol versions that are enabled by default.
-#
-
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.need.client.auth=true|false
-#      Default for this property is false. (Case for true/false ignored)
-#      If this property is specified as true in conjunction with the previous
-#      property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl" then the SSL/TLS RMI Server
-#      Socket Factory will require client authentication.
-#
-
-# For RMI monitoring with SSL client authentication use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.need.client.auth=true
-
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.registry.ssl=true|false
-#      Default for this property is false. (Case for true/false ignored)
-#      If this property is specified as true then the RMI registry used
-#      to bind the RMIServer remote object is protected with SSL/TLS
-#      RMI Socket Factories that can be configured with the properties:
-#          com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.config.file
-#          com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.enabled.cipher.suites
-#          com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.enabled.protocols
-#          com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.need.client.auth
-#      If the two properties below are true at the same time, i.e.
-#          com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=true
-#          com.sun.management.jmxremote.registry.ssl=true
-#      then the RMIServer remote object and the RMI registry are
-#      both exported with the same SSL/TLS RMI Socket Factories.
-#
-
-# For using an SSL/TLS protected RMI registry use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.registry.ssl=true
-
-#
-# ################ RMI User authentication ################
-#
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true|false
-#      Default for this property is true. (Case for true/false ignored)
-#      If this property is specified as false then no authentication is
-#      performed and all users are allowed all access.
-#
-
-# For RMI monitoring without any checking use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
-
-#
-# ################ RMI Login configuration ###################
-#
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.login.config=<config-name>
-#      Specifies the name of a JAAS login configuration entry to use when
-#      authenticating users of RMI monitoring.
-#
-#      Setting this property is optional - the default login configuration
-#      specifies a file-based authentication that uses the password file.
-#
-#      When using this property to override the default login configuration
-#      then the named configuration entry must be in a file that gets loaded
-#      by JAAS. In addition, the login module(s) specified in the configuration
-#      should use the name and/or password callbacks to acquire the user's
-#      credentials. See the NameCallback and PasswordCallback classes in the
-#      javax.security.auth.callback package for more details.
-#
-#      If the property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate" is set to
-#      false, then this property and the password & access files are ignored.
-#
-
-# For a non-default login configuration use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.login.config=<config-name>
-
-#
-# ################ RMI Password file location ##################
-#
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=filepath
-#      Specifies location for password file
-#      This is optional - default location is
-#      $JRE/lib/management/jmxremote.password
-#
-#      If the property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate" is set to
-#      false, then this property and the password & access files are ignored.
-#      Otherwise the password file must exist and be in the valid format.
-#      If the password file is empty or non-existent then no access is allowed.
-#
-
-# For a non-default password file location use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=filepath
-
-#
-# ################ RMI Access file location #####################
-#
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=filepath
-#      Specifies location for access  file
-#      This is optional - default location is
-#      $JRE/lib/management/jmxremote.access
-#
-#      If the property "com.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate" is set to
-#      false, then this property and the password & access files are ignored.
-#      Otherwise, the access file must exist and be in the valid format.
-#      If the access file is empty or non-existent then no access is allowed.
-#
-
-# For a non-default password file location use the following line
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=filepath
-#
-
-# ################ Management agent listen interface #########################
-#
-# com.sun.management.jmxremote.host=<host-or-interface-name>
-#      Specifies the local interface on which the JMX RMI agent will bind.
-#      This is useful when running on machines which have several
-#      interfaces defined. It makes it possible to listen to a specific
-#      subnet accessible through that interface.
-#
-#      The format of the value for that property is any string accepted
-#      by java.net.InetAddress.getByName(String).

-
-(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
-    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
-    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
-    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

-    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
-
-2.2. Effective Date

-become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
-distributes such Contribution.
-
-2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
-
-The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
-this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
-distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
-Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
-Contributor:
-
-(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
-    or
-
-(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
-    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
-    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
-    Version); or
-
-(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
-    its Contributions.
-
-This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
-or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
-the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
-
-2.4. Subsequent Licenses
-
-No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
-distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
-License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
-permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
-
-2.6. Fair Use
-
-This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
-applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
-equivalents.
-
-2.7. Conditions
-
-Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
-in Section 2.1.
-
-3. Responsibilities
--------------------
-
-3.1. Distribution of Source Form
-
-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
-Form.
-
-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
-
-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
-
-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
-
-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
-
-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
-
-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
-License(s).
-
-3.4. Notices
-
-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
-
-3.5. Application of Additional Terms
-
-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
-jurisdiction.
-
-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
----------------------------------------------------
-
-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
-
-5. Termination
---------------
-
-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
-Your receipt of the notice.
-
-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
-2.1 of this License shall terminate.
-
-5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
-end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
-have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
-prior to termination shall survive termination.

-*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
-*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
-*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
-*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
-*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
-*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
-*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
-*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
-*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
-*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
-*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
-*                                                                      *

-*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

-*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
-*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

-************************************************************************
-
-8. Litigation
--------------
-
-Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
-courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
-place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
-jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
-Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
-cross-claims or counter-claims.
-
-9. Miscellaneous
-----------------
-
-This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
-necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
-that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
-shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
-
-10. Versions of the License
----------------------------
-
-10.1. New Versions
-
-Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
-10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

-
-10.2. Effect of New Versions

-If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
-create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
-modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove

-such modified license differs from this License).
-

-       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

-
-6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

-   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-

-   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

-   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

-9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-   as of the date such litigation is filed.
-

-   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-

-# Authentication Scheme restrictions for HTTP and HTTPS.
-#
-# In some environments certain authentication schemes may be undesirable
-# when proxying HTTP or HTTPS.  For example, "Basic" results in effectively the
-# cleartext transmission of the user's password over the physical network.
-# This section describes the mechanism for disabling authentication schemes
-# based on the scheme name. Disabled schemes will be treated as if they are not
-# supported by the implementation.
-#
-# The 'jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes' property lists the authentication
-# schemes that will be disabled when tunneling HTTPS over a proxy, HTTP CONNECT.
-# The 'jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes' property lists the authentication
-# schemes that will be disabled when proxying HTTP.
-#
-# In both cases the property is a comma-separated list of, case-insensitive,
-# authentication scheme names, as defined by their relevant RFCs. An
-# implementation may, but is not required to, support common schemes whose names
-# include: 'Basic', 'Digest', 'NTLM', 'Kerberos', 'Negotiate'.  A scheme that
-# is not known, or not supported, by the implementation is ignored.
-#
-# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation. It
-# is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
-#
-#jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes=
-jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=Basic
-
-#
-# Transparent NTLM HTTP authentication mode on Windows. Transparent authentication
-# can be used for the NTLM scheme, where the security credentials based on the
-# currently logged in user's name and password can be obtained directly from the
-# operating system, without prompting the user. This property has three possible
-# values which regulate the behavior as shown below. Other unrecognized values
-# are handled the same as 'disabled'. Note, that NTLM is not considered to be a
-# strongly secure authentication scheme and care should be taken before enabling
-# this mechanism.
-#
-# Transparent authentication never used.
-#jdk.http.ntlm.transparentAuth=disabled
-#
-# Enabled for all hosts.
-#jdk.http.ntlm.transparentAuth=allHosts
-#
-# Enabled for hosts that are trusted in Windows Internet settings

-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2.1, February 1999
-
- Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
- the version number 2.1.]
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-introduced by others.
-
-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-libraries into non-free programs.
-
-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-the library.
-
-  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-special circumstances.
-
-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-system.
-
-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-That's all there is to it!

- * AWT native interface (new in JDK 1.3)
- *
- * The AWT native interface allows a native C or C++ application a means
- * by which to access native structures in AWT.  This is to facilitate moving
- * legacy C and C++ applications to Java and to target the needs of the
- * community who, at present, wish to do their own native rendering to canvases
- * for performance reasons.  Standard extensions such as Java3D also require a
- * means to access the underlying native data structures of AWT.
- *
- * There may be future extensions to this API depending on demand.
- *
- * A VM does not have to implement this API in order to pass the JCK.
- * It is recommended, however, that this API is implemented on VMs that support
- * standard extensions, such as Java3D.
- *
- * Since this is a native API, any program which uses it cannot be considered
- * 100% pure java.

- * AWT Native Drawing Surface (JAWT_DrawingSurface).
- *
- * For each platform, there is a native drawing surface structure.  This
- * platform-specific structure can be found in jawt_md.h.  It is recommended
- * that additional platforms follow the same model.  It is also recommended
- * that VMs on Win32 and Solaris support the existing structures in jawt_md.h.

- * for their canvas subclass to be native:

- *
- * public class MyCanvas extends Canvas {
- *

- *     }
- *
- *     public native void paint(Graphics g);

- *     result = JAWT_GetAWT(env, &awt);
- *     assert(result != JNI_FALSE);
- *
- *     // Get the drawing surface
- *     ds = awt.GetDrawingSurface(env, canvas);

- * This header file defines the data structures sent by the VM
- * through the JVMTI CompiledMethodLoad callback function via the
- * "void * compile_info" parameter. The memory pointed to by the
- * compile_info parameter may not be referenced after returning from
- * the CompiledMethodLoad callback. These are VM implementation
- * specific data structures that may evolve in future releases. A
- * JVMTI agent should interpret a non-NULL compile_info as a pointer
- * to a region of memory containing a list of records. In a typical
- * usage scenario, a JVMTI agent would cast each record to a
- * jvmtiCompiledMethodLoadRecordHeader, a struct that represents
- * arbitrary information. This struct contains a kind field to indicate
- * the kind of information being passed, and a pointer to the next
- * record. If the kind field indicates inlining information, then the
- * agent would cast the record to a jvmtiCompiledMethodLoadInlineRecord.
- * This record contains an array of PCStackInfo structs, which indicate
- * for every pc address what are the methods on the invocation stack.
- * The "methods" and "bcis" fields in each PCStackInfo struct specify a
- * 1-1 mapping between these inlined methods and their bytecode indices.
- * This can be used to derive the proper source lines of the inlined
- * methods.

-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2.1, February 1999
-
- Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
- the version number 2.1.]
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-introduced by others.
-
-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-libraries into non-free programs.
-
-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-the library.
-
-  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-special circumstances.
-
-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-system.
-
-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-That's all there is to it!

- #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its

- #
- #  NO WARRANTY
- #
- #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
- #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
- #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
- #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,

- #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
- #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
- #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
- #  any right of any third party.
- #
- #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
- #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
- #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
- #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

- #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
- #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
- #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
- #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
- #  production of secondary products from the program.
- #
- #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
- #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
- #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
- #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in

-5. Time Zone Database
-
-  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
-Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
-is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
-Database section 7.
-
- # 7.  Database Ownership
- #
- #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
- #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
- #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
- #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
- #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
- #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
- #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
- #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
- #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
- #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
- #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
- #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
- #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

-   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

-   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-   meet the following conditions:
-
-   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

-       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-       the Derivative Works; and
-
-   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-       as modifying the License.
-
-   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-   the conditions stated in this License.
-
-5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

-   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-
-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

-    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

-become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
-distributes such Contribution.
-
-2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
-
-The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
-this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
-distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
-Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
-Contributor:
-
-(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
-    or
-
-(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
-    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
-    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
-    Version); or
-
-(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
-    its Contributions.
-
-This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
-or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
-the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
-
-2.4. Subsequent Licenses
-
-No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
-
-2.6. Fair Use
-
-This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
-applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
-equivalents.
-
-2.7. Conditions
-
-Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
-in Section 2.1.
-
-3. Responsibilities
--------------------
-
-3.1. Distribution of Source Form
-
-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
-Form.
-
-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
-
-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
-
-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
-
-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
-
-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
-
-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
-License(s).
-
-3.4. Notices
-
-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
-
-3.5. Application of Additional Terms
-
-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
-jurisdiction.
-
-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
----------------------------------------------------
-
-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
-
-5. Termination
---------------
-
-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
-Your receipt of the notice.
-
-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
-2.1 of this License shall terminate.
-
-5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
-end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
-have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
-prior to termination shall survive termination.

-*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
-*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
-*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
-*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
-*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
-*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
-*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
-*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
-*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
-*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
-*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
-*                                                                      *

-*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

-*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

-*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
-*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
-*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
-*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
-*                                                                      *
-************************************************************************
-
-8. Litigation
--------------
-
-Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
-courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
-place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
-jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
-Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
-cross-claims or counter-claims.
-
-9. Miscellaneous
-----------------
-
-This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
-necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
-that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
-shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
-
-10. Versions of the License
----------------------------
-
-10.1. New Versions
-
-Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2.1, February 1999
-
- Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
- the version number 2.1.]
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-introduced by others.
-
-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-libraries into non-free programs.
-
-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-the library.
-
-  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-special circumstances.
-
-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-system.
-
-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-That's all there is to it!

- #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its

- #
- #  NO WARRANTY
- #
- #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
- #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
- #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
- #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,

- #  any right of any third party.
- #
- #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
- #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
- #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
- #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

- #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
- #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
- #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
- #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
- #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
- #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
- #  production of secondary products from the program.
- #
- #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
- #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
- #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
- #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in

-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2.1, February 1999
-
- Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
- the version number 2.1.]
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-introduced by others.
-
-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-libraries into non-free programs.
-
-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-the library.
-
-  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-special circumstances.
-
-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-system.
-
-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-That's all there is to it!

-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-Header for -agentlib:hprof (or -Xrunhprof) ASCII Output (JDK 5.0 JVMTI based)
-
-WARNING!  This file format is under development, and is subject to
-change without notice.
-
-This file contains the following types of records:
-
-THREAD START
-THREAD END      mark the lifetime of Java threads
-
-TRACE           represents a Java stack trace.  Each trace consists
-                of a series of stack frames.  Other records refer to
-                TRACEs to identify (1) where object allocations have
-                taken place, (2) the frames in which GC roots were
-                found, and (3) frequently executed methods.
-
-HEAP DUMP       is a complete snapshot of all live objects in the Java
-                heap.  Following distinctions are made:
-
-                ROOT    root set as determined by GC
-                CLS     classes 
-                OBJ     instances
-                ARR     arrays
-
-SITES           is a sorted list of allocation sites.  This identifies
-                the most heavily allocated object types, and the TRACE
-                at which those allocations occurred.
-
-CPU SAMPLES     is a statistical profile of program execution.  The VM
-                periodically samples all running threads, and assigns
-                a quantum to active TRACEs in those threads.  Entries
-                in this record are TRACEs ranked by the percentage of
-                total quanta they consumed; top-ranked TRACEs are
-                typically hot spots in the program.
-
-CPU TIME        is a profile of program execution obtained by measuring
-                the time spent in individual methods (excluding the time
-                spent in callees), as well as by counting the number of
-                times each method is called. Entries in this record are
-                TRACEs ranked by the percentage of total CPU time. The
-                "count" field indicates the number of times each TRACE 
-                is invoked.
-
-MONITOR TIME    is a profile of monitor contention obtained by measuring
-                the time spent by a thread waiting to enter a monitor.
-                Entries in this record are TRACEs ranked by the percentage
-                of total monitor contention time and a brief description
-                of the monitor.  The "count" field indicates the number of 
-                times the monitor was contended at that TRACE.
-
-MONITOR DUMP    is a complete snapshot of all the monitors and threads in 
-                the System.
-
-HEAP DUMP, SITES, CPU SAMPLES|TIME and MONITOR DUMP|TIME records are generated 
-at program exit.  They can also be obtained during program execution by typing 
-Ctrl-\ (on Solaris) or by typing Ctrl-Break (on Win32).

-
-ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
-sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
-ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
-by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
-that you must include source code if you redistribute it.
-(See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is
-not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not
-limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
-
-The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
-It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
-The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
-ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
-by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
-
-It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
-by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding
-cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this
-reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
-JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
-over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
-implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are
-no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
-
-The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
-To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
-has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
-produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;
-the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all

-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2.1, February 1999
-
- Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
- the version number 2.1.]
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-introduced by others.
-
-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-libraries into non-free programs.
-
-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-the library.
-
-  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-special circumstances.
-
-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-system.
-
-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-

-   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

-       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-       the Derivative Works; and
-
-   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

-       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

-   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

-   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2.1, February 1999
-
- Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
- the version number 2.1.]
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-introduced by others.
-
-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-libraries into non-free programs.
-
-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-the library.
-
-  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-special circumstances.
-
-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-system.
-
-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-That's all there is to it!

-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2.1, February 1999
-
- Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
- the version number 2.1.]
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-introduced by others.
-
-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-libraries into non-free programs.
-
-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-the library.
-
-  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-special circumstances.
-
-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-system.
-
-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice

-That's all there is to it!

-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2.1, February 1999
-
- Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
- the version number 2.1.]
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
-
-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
-these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
-
-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
-introduced by others.
-
-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
-
-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
-libraries into non-free programs.
-
-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
-the library.
-
-  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
-special circumstances.
-
-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
-
-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
-system.
-
-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
-that program using a modified version of the Library.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
-"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
-be combined with the library in order to run.
-
-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
-this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
-Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
-
-  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
-which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
-Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
-included without limitation in the term "modification".)
-
-  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
-and installation of the library.
-
-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
-and what the program that uses the Library does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
-Library.
-
-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
-fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
-
-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
-    in the event an application does not supply such function or
-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
-    its purpose remains meaningful.
-
-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
-    root function must still compute square roots.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
-it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Library.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
-these notices.
-
-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
-
-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
-the Library into a program that is not a library.
-
-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
-medium customarily used for software interchange.
-
-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
-linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
-
-  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
-contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
-
-  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
-
-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-Library will still fall under Section 6.)
-
-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
-
-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
-link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
-engineering for debugging such modifications.
-
-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
-of these things:
-
-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
-    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
-    to use the modified definitions.)
-
-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
-
-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
-    least three years, to give the same user the materials
-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
-    than the cost of performing this distribution.
-
-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
-    specified materials from the same place.
-
-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
-
-  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
-Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
-the executable.
-
-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
-distribute.
-
-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
-
-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
-    Sections above.
-
-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
-
-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Library or works based on it.
-
-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
-this License.
-
-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
-written in the body of this License.
-
-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
-"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
-the Free Software Foundation.
-
-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
-and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
-DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
-
-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
-ordinary General Public License).
-
-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
-"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
-    Lesser General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
-    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
-  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-That's all there is to it!

-#
-# This properties file is used to initialize the default
-# java.awt.datatransfer.SystemFlavorMap. It contains the Win32 platform-
-# specific, default mappings between common Win32 Clipboard atoms and platform-
-# independent MIME type strings, which will be converted into
-# java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavors.
-#
-# These default mappings may be augmented by specifying the
-#
-#       AWT.DnD.flavorMapFileURL 
-#
-# property in the appropriate awt.properties file. The specified properties URL
-# will be loaded into the SystemFlavorMap.
-#
-# The standard format is:
-#
-# <native>=<MIME type>
-#
-# <native> should be a string identifier that the native platform will
-# recognize as a valid data format. <MIME type> should specify both a MIME
-# primary type and a MIME subtype separated by a '/'. The MIME type may include
-# parameters, where each parameter is a key/value pair separated by '=', and
-# where each parameter to the MIME type is separated by a ';'.
-#
-# Because SystemFlavorMap implements FlavorTable, developers are free to
-# duplicate both native keys and DataFlavor values. If a mapping contains a
-# duplicate key or value, earlier mappings which included this key or value
-# will be preferred.
-#
-# Mappings whose values specify DataFlavors with primary MIME types of
-# "text", and which support the charset parameter, should specify the exact
-# format in which the native platform expects the data. The "charset"
-# parameter specifies the char to byte encoding, the "eoln" parameter
-# specifies the end-of-line marker, and the "terminators" parameter specifies
-# the number of terminating NUL bytes. Note that "eoln" and "terminators"
-# are not standardized MIME type parameters. They are specific to this file
-# format ONLY. They will not appear in any of the DataFlavors returned by the
-# SystemFlavorMap at the Java level.
-#
-# If the "charset" parameter is omitted, or has zero length, the platform
-# default encoding is assumed. If the "eoln" parameter is omitted, or has
-# zero length, "\n" is assumed. If the "terminators" parameter is omitted,
-# or has a value less than zero, zero is assumed.
-#
-# Upon initialization, the data transfer subsystem will record the specified
-# details of the native text format, but the default SystemFlavorMap will
-# present a large set of synthesized DataFlavors which map, in both
-# directions, to the native. After receiving data from the application in one
-# of the synthetic DataFlavors, the data transfer subsystem will transform
-# the data stream into the format specified in this file before passing the
-# transformed stream to the native system.
-#
-# Mappings whose values specify DataFlavors with primary MIME types of
-# "text", but which do not support the charset parameter, will be treated as
-# opaque, 8-bit data. They will not undergo any transformation process, and
-# any "charset", "eoln", or "terminators" parameters specified in this file
-# will be ignored.
-#
-# See java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor.selectBestTextFlavor for a list of
-# text flavors which support the charset parameter.
